# React Refresh Webpack Plugin

An **EXPERIMENTAL** Webpack plugin to enable "Fast Refresh" (also previously known as _Hot Reloading_) for React components.

## Installation

First - this plugin is not 100% stable.
It works pretty reliably, and we have been testing it for some time, but there are still edge cases yet to be discovered.
Please **DO NOT** use it if you cannot afford to face breaking changes in the future.

```sh
# if you prefer npm
npm install -D react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh

# if you prefer yarn
yarn add -D react-refresh-webpack-plugin react-refresh
```

## Usage

First, apply the plugin in your Webpack configuration as follows:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
const ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('react-refresh-webpack-plugin');
// ... your other imports

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin(),
  ],
};
```

Then, update your Babel configuration.
This can either be done in your Webpack config (via options of `babel-loader`), or in the form of a `.babelrc`/`babel.config.js`.

**webpack.config.js** (if you choose to inline the config)

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ... other rules
      {
        // for TypeScript, change the following to "\.[jt]sx?"
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          // ... other loaders
          {
            loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
            options: {
              // ... other options
              // DO NOT apply the plugin in production mode!
              plugins: [require.resolve('react-refresh/babel')],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

**.babelrc** (if you choose to extract the config)

```json5
{
  plugins: ['react-refresh/babel'],
}
```

## Options

This plugin accepts a few options that are specifically targeted for advanced users.
The allowed values are as follows:

|           Name            |   Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                      |
| :-----------------------: | :-------: | :-----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`disableRefreshCheck`** | `boolean` | `false` | Disables detection of react-refresh's Babel plugin. Useful if you have a Babel setup that is not entirely controlled by Webpack. |
|     **`forceEnable`**     | `boolean` | `false` | Enables the plugin forcefully. Useful if you want to use the plugin in production, for example.                                  |
